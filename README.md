# FxTwitter-Discord-Bot
A side project utilizing discord.py API and the TwitFix repository


 to do list: 
1) Make the bot be able to read if the twitter link has the twitter link at all (use regex for this)
2) Have the bot delete the message
  | Have the bot say who posted the twitter link (prefereably without a ping)


 Things to consider:
 1) Maybe make a flag (ex: make it ![twitter link] symbol not specific)
 2) if twitfix "failed to scan link " -> display an error message
 3) Maybe make it so that if someone replies to a message and pings the bot it'll embed twitter link
