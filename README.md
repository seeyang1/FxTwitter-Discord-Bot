# vxTwitter-Discord-Bot
A side project utilizing discord.py API and the TwitFix repository


 to do list: 
1) ~~Make the bot be able to read if the twitter link has the twitter link at all (use regex for this)~~
2) ~~Have the bot delete the message
  | Have the bot say who posted the twitter link (prefereably without a ping)~~
3) **make the bot check to see if there's an embed or video at all within the tweet (there's no need to fix embeds if there's no image/video) 
  | might make it check only for videos as the main use for vxtwitter is for videos**
4) Make it so that if someone replies to a message with a twitter link with video and pings the bot it'll embed twitter link


 Things to consider:
 1) Maybe make a flag (ex: make it ![twitter link] symbol not specific)
 2) if twitfix "failed to scan link " -> display an error message
